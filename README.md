# VR Puzzle Room

VR Puzzle Room is a brief puzzle game made with Unity/C# for Oculus platforms. The project was solo-developed over three weeks for an assignment at Holberton School. The goal of the project was to explore the design and development of VR locomotion and interaction systems. Both the teleportation and interaction systems in VR Puzzle Room were written from scratch in C#.

I also designed and implemented the storage hold keyboard's UI and functionality, as well as all game audio.

## How To Play

You find yourself locked in the storage hold of a mysterious space station. Find a way out of the hold and activate the star console in the main room for a mesmerizing experience.

### Controls

- Teleport: right thumbstick and index trigger to teleport.

- Grab: right hand trigger to grab objects.

- Interact: right index trigger to interact objects.

## Assets

### Level Design & Models

The models and level design were provided in a starter project by the Holberton School curriculum. Meshes and materials were sourced from the [Sci-Fi Styled Modular Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-styled-modular-pack-82913) by karboosx via the Unity Asset Store.

### Audio & Lighting

I designed and implemented game audio/SFX. I also modified lighting from what was provided in the project starter.
